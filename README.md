This project is a challenge from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/todo-list-api) designed to help you build a RESTful API for managing to-do lists. It demonstrates how to create, update, delete, and retrieve to-do tasks with proper user authentication and data persistence.

## Project Overview

The **To-Do List API** allows users to manage tasks efficiently. It includes features like:

- User authentication (sign-up and login).
- Creating, updating, and deleting to-do items.
- Organizing tasks into categories or lists.
- Setting task priorities and deadlines.
- Marking tasks as complete/incomplete.
- Pagination, filtering, and sorting of tasks.
- API documentation (Swagger or OpenAPI).

## Features

1. **User Management**:
    - Register: `POST /api/auth/register`
    - Login: `POST /api/auth/login`

2. **To-Do List Management**:
    - Create Task: `POST /api/todos`
    - Get All Tasks: `GET /api/todos`
    - Get Task by ID: `GET /api/todos/{id}`
    - Update Task: `PUT /api/todos/{id}`
    - Delete Task: `DELETE /api/todos/{id}`

3. **Advanced Task Features**:
    - Mark Task as Completed: `PATCH /api/todos/{id}/complete`
    - Set Task Deadline: `PATCH /api/todos/{id}/deadline`
    - Categorize Tasks (optional): `POST /api/categories`

4. **Sorting, Filtering & Pagination**:
    - Filter tasks by status, deadline, or priority.
    - Pagination for task retrieval.
    - Sort tasks by creation date, priority, or deadline.

5. **API Documentation**:
    - Swagger UI available at `/swagger-ui.html`.

- Java 11 or higher (if using Spring Boot) or Node.js (if using Express.js).
- PostgreSQL or another relational database (for task persistence).
- Maven or Gradle (for Java projects) or npm (for Node.js projects).
- An API client like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test the endpoints.
